## Simple Hacker News
This is a minimalist [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) interface built with React that fetches data from the [Hacker News API](https://github.com/HackerNews/API) and displays the top 300 stories. The aim was to create a decluttered interface that is easier on the eyes. I also wanted to gain experience with React and interacting with a JSON API. [See deployment here](https://intense-brook-19858.herokuapp.com/).

### Built with
* [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
* [React JS](https://reactjs.org/) version 16.13
* Vanilla CSS (i.e. no frameworks used)

### To-do List
- [x] Build front-end
- [x] Deploy app
- [ ] Fix up mobile styles (dark mode messes up the header)
- [ ] Add custom domain name?

### Status
Finished for now. I might return to it later to add features.

### Inspiration
The front-end design was heavily inspired by [hckr news](https://hckrnews.com/).

### Misc
* Check out the switch on the right side of the header. And then please forgive me.
