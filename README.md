### Hacker News Client
This is a React client that fetches data from the Hacker News API ([see here](https://github.com/HackerNews/API)) and displays it. 

I wanted experience interacting with an API and using React outide of a sandbox.

NOTE: The current version of this project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) so I could focus on the code, but I plan to rebuild it from scratch.
